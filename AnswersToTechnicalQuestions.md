######1.	How long did you spend on the technical test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the technical test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.

It took approximately 6 hours for me to complete the assignment.
The framework is very basic style.It needs to be more organised incorporating oops concepts.The scenarios can be made outlined for multiple area codes or Data driven style.
I have not used logging,screenshots and reporting which will give better user experience.Also the application could be tested in terms of performance and accessibility.

######2.	What do you think is the most interesting trend in test automation?
 Codeless Test Automation
 Robotic Process Automation  
 Blend of Agile and Devops
 
######3.   How would you implement test automation in a legacy application? Have you ever had to do this?
I have tested legacy systems based on cobol.The applications are very slow and not user friendly.
Automating would be a difficult task.However, I will try to do some research and see for possibilities of automation.

######4.   How would you improve the customer experience of the JUST EAT website?
1.Adding order to the cart is a bit difficult as it keeps on giving multiple options and therby confusing the customer.
2.The Add to cart button is not enabled till the minimum amount id added.
3.The Automation for user login is not possible as the captcha is enable.However,in test environments these can be handled by disabling in the backend.
4.The customer should also be provided a customer support number displayed on the website to order on call from the desired restaurant.
5.Also a live chatbot would be helpful to guide people. 
6.The timing of the delivery service should be displayed on the home page, so that the customers are aware and plan accordingly.
